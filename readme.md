# py_pdf_copy

It is a small script that manipulates text copied from PDF and formats it so that line breaks are removed.
It is built for linux, and depends on `xsel` in the background.

## Installation
Just copy and paste the `py_pdf_copy.py` file to `/usr/bin/` or your preferred location. Sometimes it is necessary to remove the `.py` extension to make it recognizable as a executable file instead of a editable text file. If necessary, do that as well. Assigning a shortcut varies in each distro, so please find your own way to do so.

# Usage
Instead of doing `ctrl c -> ctrl v`, you do this: `ctrl c -> py_pdf_copy -> ctrl v`
